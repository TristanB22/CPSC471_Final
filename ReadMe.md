# CPSC 471 Final Project

This directory contains all of the code that is used for the final project for CPSC471. Within it, we have the following directories that have the following funcitons:

| Folder Name | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------ |
| models | This folder contains all of the code that is needed to run the program itself. Within it, one can find files such as `health_insrurance_base_models.ipynb` which forms the core of this repository along with the private and public example keys for model encryption and decryption. If one uses any of thise code for development or personal use, please make sure to generate these keys again to mitigate against security leaks. |
