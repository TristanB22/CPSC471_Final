# Runthroughs

This directory contains all of the full runthroughs of the notebook that we have completed so far. They are named rather esoterically, and therefore have the following explanations attached. The files are the same in each of the folders, but documenting the different possible outcomes from this method. 

| Model Folder Name       | Description                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| run_* | Any folder with a run_* name is a temporary storage space for a runthrough of the entire notebook that has not been analyzed yet |
| 4_models_with_error_bars        | Contains all of the graphs and models that were generated with the first full run of the notebook with 4 mdoels: the baseline (PCA), augmented (PCA), full model, and single layer (PCA) models; this notebook uses the summation method instead of the product method |
| 3_models_successful_run         | Contains all of the information for the run with the baseline (PCA), augmented (PCA), and single layer (PCA) models |
| first_full_run_kmeans           |	The first run of the notebook using the kmeans clustering method in the PCA space of the features when computing the relative distances |
| half_half_good_coefficients     |	A converged run of the notebook showing the extra conceptual understanding of later vertexes in the model doped with our augmenting strategy |
| good_early_high_late_same       | A converged run showing another potential outcome of the model with the doped augmenting strategy |
| monotonically_above_with_bars   | A converged notebook where the information representation of the doped nodes is monotonically above the baseline model representation across the board |
| good_total_expression           | A converged notebook created early in this creation process to test that the node doping was happening | 
| best_total_expression_yet       | A converged notebook showing good expression from the doped nodes late in the model |
| great_total_above               | Shows an instance of the notebook where the representation in the augmented nodes is monotonically above the baseline | 
| solid_epsilon_jump_sum          | An auxiliary converged notebook in the case we need more runs to analyze in the report |
